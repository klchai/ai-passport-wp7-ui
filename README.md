# AI Passport · WP7 Tile UI

A standalone ESP-IDF application for the **FoloToy AI Passport**. It ports [ZyoungInc's WP7-style LVGL UI](https://github.com/ZyoungInc/JC4880P443C_BSP/tree/wp7) to the Passport's ESP32-C3, 240 × 320 ST7789P3 color display, and three physical buttons. The upstream page objects, settings, and transitions are adapted directly. The original Passport terminal application lives in a separate project.

## Features and current state

- Two-column color tiles, application list, and the original UI Settings entrance and exit transitions, which every app page uses too. Brightness, dark mode, theme color, animation speed, and fast animations are saved in NVS.
- **Clock:** set from the Mac with each Bluetooth push (see below), or by hand with the buttons. The time is lost on power-off; the status bar shows `--:--` until the next push or manual setting.
- **Battery:** reads state of charge and cell voltage from the onboard CW2017 gauge; reports unavailable when it cannot read the sensor.
- **Stopwatch:** start, pause, lap, and reset. Timing continues while the page is closed.
- **Focus:** 5/15/25/45-minute presets. Timing continues while the page is closed. It has no home tile; open it from the app list.
- **Kaboo:** token count and cost for today, 7 days or 30 days, plus the top model, received over Bluetooth LE from `tools/usage_bridge.py` on a Mac.
- **Claude:** 5-hour and 7-day quota use with reset countdowns, received over Bluetooth LE from `tools/usage_bridge.py` on a Mac. A window's percentage and bar use the theme color, turn yellow at 70% and red at 90%. It shows "Waiting for Mac" until the first update and marks data older than 15 minutes as stale; it never invents usage data.
- **Status bar:** battery percentage and icon from the fuel gauge, and a Bluetooth icon: solid when the Mac has sent data in the last 3 minutes, dimmed while waiting for it, hidden if Bluetooth failed to start. The Wi-Fi icon stays hidden because Wi-Fi is not enabled.

The target board is the **FoloToy AI Passport with an ESP32-C3, 8 MB flash, no PSRAM, a 240 × 320 ST7789P3 SPI display, and three ADC buttons**. Other ESP32 boards need changes to the pins, display, and input drivers in `components/passport_bsp`.

## On-device screenshots

| Home tiles | UI Settings |

These two 240 × 320 PNGs were reconstructed from actual display updates over the Passport's USB serial port and preserve the original screen layout and pixels.

## Buttons

| Page | Up / Down click | Up / Down hold | OK click | OK hold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tiles | Select a tile | Hold Down for the app list | Open the selected tile, or the list if none is selected | Open the list |
| App list | Select an item | — | Open the item | Return to tiles |
| UI Settings | Select a control | — | Change the control | Return |
| Clock | Add 1 hour / 1 minute | Add 6 hours / 10 minutes | — | Return |
| Kaboo | Change period | — | — | Return |
| Claude | — | — | — | Return |
| Stopwatch | Lap / reset while paused | — | Start / pause | Return |
| Focus | Change preset / reset while paused | — | Start / pause | Return |

Every page, UI Settings or an app, opens from its tile or list row with the upstream UI Settings entrance: the other tiles or rows clear, the selected one zooms away, then the title and rows slide in. Holding OK plays it in reverse. Keys are ignored for the second or so that a transition runs.

A thin outline marks the selected control because the Passport has no touchscreen; it is hidden while a page opens and returns when the page closes. A hold is 0.8 s. A click registers when the key is released, so quick repeated presses all count; while OK is held, the selected tile or list row sinks in.

## Build and flash

1. Install and activate **ESP-IDF 5.5.3** using [Espressif's ESP32-C3 setup guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v5.5/esp32c3/get-started/index.html). Check the active version with `idf.py --version`.
2. Build from the repository root:

   ```sh
   idf.py set-target esp32c3
   idf.py build
   ```

   On the first build, the component manager downloads LVGL, `esp_lvgl_port`, and `button`; resolved versions are in `dependencies.lock`. The resulting app image is `build/passport_wp7.bin`.

   An existing `sdkconfig` keeps its old values. After `sdkconfig.defaults` changes, for example the `-O2` optimization level, run `idf.py set-target esp32c3` again or delete `sdkconfig` before building.
3. Connect the Passport with a data cable, verify its USB serial port and check that its partition layout matches `partitions.csv`. Replace `PORT` with the actual port, such as `/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX` on macOS, `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux, or a `COM` port on Windows:

   ```sh
   idf.py -p PORT app-flash
   idf.py -p PORT monitor
   ```

   `app-flash` updates only the application partition; it does not write the bootloader, partition table, or NVS. Exit the monitor with `Ctrl+]`. Close any other application holding the port before flashing.

This repository's partition table targets the Passport layout already verified for this port. Check the layout first on another hardware batch or a device with changed partitions. A full `idf.py flash` also writes the bootloader and partition table; use it only on a dedicated development board or after confirming that layout is appropriate. Generated `build/`, `managed_components/`, and local `sdkconfig` files are not committed; `sdkconfig.defaults` supplies the project settings.

## Send Kaboo and Claude usage from a Mac

The firmware advertises as `FoloPassport`. On a Mac with Bluetooth, install `bleak` (`pip install 'bleak>=0.19'`) and run:

```sh
python3 tools/usage_bridge.py --once   # one update, then exit
python3 tools/usage_bridge.py          # update every 60 s
```

The bridge reads the local Kaboo and Claude Code snapshots described at the top of the script. Both pages show "Waiting for Mac" until the first update and mark data older than 15 minutes as stale. `--dry-run` prints the packed payload without Bluetooth.

## Capture the physical display

The firmware serves a read-only screenshot command over USB serial. Leave the device on the desired page and run:

```sh
python tools/capture_wp7.py --port PORT \
  --output screenshots/capture.png --wait-for-enter
```

When the script prints `Serial ready`, check the display and press Enter. It reconstructs a PNG from the actual RGB565 flush regions, so the ESP32-C3 needs no additional full-screen buffer. Python needs `pyserial`, which is included in the ESP-IDF environment; standalone use can install `tools/requirements.txt`.
