# Upstream and port

- Source: `ZyoungInc/JC4880P443C_BSP`, `wp7` branch, commit
  `9d1743a9444a8d1fe9226e24c7f2b930e22f8612`.
- Original UI file: `main/main.c`, copied to `main/wp7_ui.c`; its SPDX header
  remains in place. The repository's default `main` branch runs
  `lv_demo_widgets()` and is not the WP7 source.
- Preserved: original WP7 screen objects, themes, list and settings pages,
  transitions, and NVS state.
- Replaced: ESP32-P4 MIPI-DSI/PSRAM/touch BSP with Passport ESP32-C3
  ST7789P3 SPI display, 40-line internal-RAM LVGL buffer, and three ADC keys.
- Adjusted for 240 × 320: font sizes, grid tile size, settings vertical scale,
  and default blue theme. Added a key focus outline and key-to-UI action bridge.
- Changed LVGL's refresh period from 33 ms to the upstream 15 ms. Animation
  speed and fast animations remain controlled by the upstream settings page.
- Increased LVGL's memory pool from 64 KiB to 96 KiB. The original settings
  exit animation completes from both tiles and the app list with this pool.
- Sized Passport settings labels to their 16/22 px font line heights and made
  the palette smaller so sliders and swatches no longer cover text.
- Replaced numbered tiles and demo list entries with named applications; added
  Passport pages and the onboard CW2017 battery gauge. The former AI Usage
  entry is now two pages, Kaboo token usage and Claude quota, fed over
  Bluetooth LE. They take the first two home tiles; Focus moved to the app
  list only.
- The original demo is not a phone OS; the Passport build adds functional
  pages for the five non-settings app rows.

## Source and license boundaries

- `main/usage_model.*`, `main/usage_link.*`, `tools/usage_bridge.py` and
  `tests/test_usage_model.c` come from
  [klchai/ai-passport-liquid-glass-ui](https://github.com/klchai/ai-passport-liquid-glass-ui)
  (MIT License, FoloToy; same text as `LICENSES/FoloToy-MIT.txt`). The only
  change is in `usage_link.c`: the time base for payload validation is the
  last packet accepted during this boot instead of that project's `time_sync`
  module, so Wi-Fi and SNTP are not linked.

- `components/passport_bsp/` is a reduced, adapted copy of
  [`components/bsp/` from FoloToy/ai-passport](https://github.com/FoloToy/ai-passport).
  The checked base revision was `1051209d807fb26f943236b7e02281f13d39bc90`.
  The ES8311 audio driver (`bsp_audio.*`, `bsp_es8311_sleep_check.*`) was
  copied unchanged from revision `a59ee9e408b25828131cdf8a01905f5778e6083f`.
  Its MIT License is preserved in [`LICENSES/FoloToy-MIT.txt`](LICENSES/FoloToy-MIT.txt).
- The upstream file adapted into `main/wp7_ui.c` carries
  `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`; the license text is in
  [`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`](LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt). The upstream `wp7`
  branch does not contain a root `LICENSE` file, so that file-level header
  should not be described as a repository-wide license grant.
- Display and button sources in the BSP retain their original `trae_card`
  porting comments; no separate `trae_card` source is vendored here. LVGL and
  Espressif components are fetched by the component manager and are not committed.
- A license for this repository's newly written code has not been selected.
  The copies under `LICENSES/` preserve source notices; they do not license
  this entire new repository.
